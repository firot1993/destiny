# Destiny

Destiny is a Next.js app for generating literary "possible futures" from a staged questionnaire, a Big Five personality read, and a short human curation step.

The current product is not a literal diffusion model. It is a prompt chain that scans for future fragments, lets the user catch the ones that feel charged, then denoises them into a finished narrative.

## Experience Flow

1. Fill out a four-chapter questionnaire in `Now`, `Unstable`, `Pull`, and `Motion`.
2. Rate the Big Five sliders to shape behavioral tone rather than surface facts.
3. Generate 10 story fragments, then catch the bullets you want to keep.
4. Answer two post-curation questions about why those fragments matter and which future you are refusing.
5. Fire the chamber and run a multi-step rewrite loop that turns the selected motifs into a finished life-path story.

```

Provider responses are normalized to Anthropic-style text blocks before returning to the client. Optional rate limiting uses Upstash Redis for per-IP throttling plus a global daily cap, and the UI caches the daily quota snapshot in `localStorage`.

The in-app provider picker currently ships with OpenRouter and xAI presets from `lib/constants.ts`. The route adapter also contains direct Anthropic and Gemini support if the request body uses those providers.

When Supabase is configured, the app also records anonymous session telemetry, LLM calls, curated bullets, final stories, and story ratings for later analysis and dataset building. When it is not configured, telemetry calls are silent no-ops.

# Agentic pipeline configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=  # optional, comma-separated fallback provider chain (e.g. "anthropic,xai")
```

## Generation Pipeline

1. `Questionnaire`  
   `lib/questionnaire.ts` builds a route-aware multi-step form. Answers are normalized into the `Fields` shape used by prompts.

2. `Conditioning`  
   `buildStoryConditioning(...)` converts questionnaire answers, Big Five scores, and later curation answers into:
   - hard state
   - latent forces
   - personality signature

3. `Scan`  
   Step `0` in `generateStepPrompt(...)` asks the model for 10 unresolved future fragments. `parseNoiseFragments(...)` converts the raw response into bullets.

4. `Diversity Check`  
   After the scan, `generateDiversityCheckPrompt(...)` scores the 10 fragments for thematic overlap. Near-duplicates are replaced via a single re-scan pass. This is best-effort and never blocks the user.

5. `Curate`  
   `BulletField` and `AmmoHUD` let the user catch up to 6 fragments into the revolver chamber. The user then answers `whyThese` and `rejectedFuture` before firing.

6. `Denoise` (adaptive agentic loop)  
   `useGeneration.ts` runs a staged rewrite loop with self-assessment:
   - **structure** — initial draft from selected fragments
   - **critique** — identifies weaknesses in the structure draft
   - **steering pause** — user can optionally type a one-line direction (auto-skips after 15s)
   - **sharpen/refine** — rewrites addressing critique notes + optional steering note
   - **revision verification** — checks if sharpen addressed the critique; runs a targeted fix pass if not
   - **quality gate** — scores the draft 1-10; triggers extra sharpen passes if below threshold (max 2 extra)
   - **final story** — full 4-paragraph story (streamed via SSE when provider supports it)

   The hook also injects ordered bullet text plus a signature author chosen by `lib/styles.ts`.

7. `Cleanup`  
   A final cleanup prompt strips obvious questionnaire language and keeps the finished trajectory concrete.

## Reliability

- **Retry with backoff** — Every upstream LLM call retries up to 2 times with exponential backoff on 429/5xx errors.
- **Fallback providers** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_FALLBACK_PROVIDERS` (comma-separated) defines a fallback chain tried when the primary provider fails with a retryable error.
- **Streaming** — The final story step streams via SSE for OpenRouter and xAI, showing words as they arrive. Falls back to non-streaming for unsupported providers.

## Persistence And Telemetry

The app can persist questionnaire answers, bullet selections, intermediate LLM calls, final stories, and user ratings to Postgres so the team can study generations and export fine-tuning datasets. The schema lives under `supabase/migrations/`.

```bash
npm run db:start
npm run db:reset
```

`npm run db:start` requires Docker and boots local Postgres plus Supabase Studio. After startup, copy the printed `service_role` key into `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`. Studio is available at `http://localhost:54323`.

For production, link the repo to a Supabase project and run `npm run db:push` to promote migrations.

Telemetry is anonymous and session-based:

- A UUID stored in `localStorage` (`destiny-session-uuid`) identifies the browser session
- `/api/telemetry` records session start, curate completion, final story completion, and like/dislike feedback
- `/api/generate` can also persist per-phase LLM request/response pairs when a `sessionId` is present

Captured data includes:

- Questionnaire answers, Big Five scores, language, provider/model, and story conditioning
- Every LLM request/response pair across `scan`, `structure`, `critique`, `sharpen`, `final`, and `cleanup`
- Which fragments the user caught, their chamber order, curation answers, and chosen author voice
- The final story plus thumbs-up / thumbs-down feedback

No IP address, auth account, or browser fingerprint is stored in the telemetry schema. See `doc/architecture/telemetry-and-persistence.md` for more detail.

## Rate Limiting

Optional, enabled when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` is set:

- Per-IP throttling via Upstash Redis
- A global daily cap returned in `X-Daily-Remaining` / `X-Daily-Limit` headers and cached client-side in `localStorage`

## Product Notes

- The questionnaire is chapter-based, not a plain profile form.
- Big Five scores affect behavior and tone, not just labels.
- The curate phase is a real user choice point, not a cosmetic animation.
- The denoise pipeline is an adaptive agentic loop — it self-assesses draft quality, runs multi-round critique, and accepts mid-generation user steering.
- Scan fragments go through a diversity check to avoid near-duplicates in the revolver.
- The final output is a literary future narrative shaped by a multi-pass rewrite loop with streaming support.
- LLM calls retry with exponential backoff and fall through to configured fallback providers.
- Gemini's web search grounding can be toggled on for real-world-anchored story fragments.
- Users can rate the finished story with a simple like/dislike control.
- Current i18n support is English and Simplified Chinese.
